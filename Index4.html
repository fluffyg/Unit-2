<h1>All in all.</h1>
<p>there is a compelling argument on both sides. On one hand you can help your friends, and yourself, especially if there is a harsh teacher, or you were absent. On the other had it can hurt people, and cause gades to be thrown out. In my opinion if you could hack the school it would be good to help out those who truly need it. I wouldn't use it to help a person who never tried, but if somone was struggling, maybe esrasing a few missing assignments is not the worst thing in the world..</p>
