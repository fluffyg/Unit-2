<h1>Thumbs Up</h1>
<p>There are many reasons why someone would want to alter grades. One might want to give themselves a better grade or fix the grade of a friend, when it was unfairly against them, or they just did not do well enough. They could also change the grades to help people who are struggling, or damage the grades of someone who deserves it like a bully. While there is great potential for someone to do a lot of harm in the schools system there is a lot that could be done to ease the lives of their peirs. </p>
