<h1>Thumbs Down</h1>
<p>while there is a strong argument to hack the school there are many reasons why it is a bad idea. firstly it may be used to harm people who do not deserve it. Sabatoging someones grades may affect their future, especially if they are in their junior or senior year. Also if you are caught it's possible that the school will throw out the grades during the time you were in the data base. Lastly it is unethical, why it may seem appeling to change your grades it may come back to bite you because you never learned the material and did not try.</p>
